# Sprint 1 Comprehensive Testing

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive test scripts for validating all Sprint 1 deliverables of the Last-Mile Delivery Control Tower project.

## Test Scripts

### sprint-1-comprehensive-test.ps1
A PowerShell script that performs comprehensive testing of all Sprint 1 requirements:
- Core Entity API Testing (Drivers, Shipments, Routes)
- Admin Interface CRUD Operations
- Dashboard UI Functionality
- Database Schema Validation
- Success Criteria Verification

### Test Categories
1. **Core Entity API Tests** - Validates all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
2. **Admin Interface CRUD Tests** - Tests full create, read, update, delete functionality
3. **Dashboard UI Tests** - Verifies frontend components load correctly
4. **Database Schema Tests** - Ensures proper relationships and data models
5. **Success Criteria Tests** - Validates all Sprint 1 success criteria

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Internet access to the deployed Vercel application

### Execution
```powershell
# Navigate to the tests directory
cd tests

# Run the comprehensive Sprint 1 test suite
.\sprint-1-comprehensive-test.ps1
```

### Expected Output
The test script will:
1. Run all test cases in sequence
2. Display real-time results with ✅ for passes and ❌ for failures
3. Provide a summary of total tests, passes, and failures
4. Indicate overall Sprint 1 completion status

## Test Coverage

### Backend APIs
- ✅ GET /api/drivers - List all drivers
- ✅ GET /api/drivers/:id - Get specific driver
- ✅ POST /api/drivers - Create new driver
- ✅ PUT /api/drivers/:id - Update driver
- ✅ DELETE /api/drivers/:id - Delete driver

- ✅ GET /api/shipments - List all shipments
- ✅ GET /api/shipments/:id - Get specific shipment
- ✅ POST /api/shipments - Create new shipment
- ✅ PUT /api/shipments/:id - Update shipment
- ✅ DELETE /api/shipments/:id - Delete shipment

- ✅ GET /api/routes - List all routes
- ✅ GET /api/routes/:id - Get specific route
- ✅ POST /api/routes - Create new route
- ✅ PUT /api/routes/:id - Update route
- ✅ DELETE /api/routes/:id - Delete route

### Data Models
- ✅ Driver model validation (id, name, phone, vehicle_type, status, current_location, timestamps)
- ✅ Shipment model validation (id, tracking_number, status, origin, destination, timestamps)
- ✅ Route model validation (id, shipment_id, waypoints, status, timestamps)
- ✅ Database relationships (driver-shipment, shipment-route)

### Frontend Components
- ✅ Dashboard loads correctly
- ✅ Admin interface accessible
- ✅ All UI components render properly
- ✅ Responsive design elements

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All core entity APIs functional with error handling
- ✅ Dispatcher dashboard displays shipments, routes, and driver status
- ✅ Admin interface allows creation and management of core entities
- ✅ Database schema implemented with proper relationships
- ✅ Application deployed to vercel.app and accessible

## Notes
- Some POST/PUT/DELETE operations may fail on Vercel serverless deployment due to platform limitations
- The script uses Egyptian coordinates for test data to match the current database seeding
- All tests are designed to be non-destructive of existing production data
