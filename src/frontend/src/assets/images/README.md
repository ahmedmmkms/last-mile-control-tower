# Logistics Background Images

This directory contains background images for the Last-Mile Delivery Control Tower dashboard.

## Image Requirements

For the enhanced dashboard design, we need a subtle logistics-themed background image that meets these criteria:

1. Size: <100KB (optimize for web)
2. Format: 
   - Primary: AVIF (smallest file size)
   - Fallback: WebP
   - Ultimate fallback: JPG/PNG
3. Content: Subtle logistics imagery (containers, routes, trucks, aerial city network)
4. Style: Low-contrast, faded appearance that doesn't compete with content
5. Dimensions: 1920x1080px or larger (will be scaled to cover)
