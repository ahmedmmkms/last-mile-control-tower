# Testing Approach for PWA Functionality

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality and real-time features in Sprint 2 of the Last-Mile Delivery Control Tower system. It consolidates and extends the existing testing strategies, implementation plans, and manual testing procedures.

## 1. Testing Strategy Summary

### 1.1. PWA Testing Focus Areas
- **Installability**: Web app manifest validation and installation prompts
- **Offline Functionality**: Caching strategies and offline page display
- **Service Worker**: Registration verification and background sync
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-device layout and interaction testing

### 1.2. Real-Time Communication Testing Focus Areas
- **WebSocket/Socket.IO**: Connection establishment and data updates
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: REST API fallback when WebSocket connections fail
- **Performance**: Load testing with multiple concurrent connections
- **Resilience**: Connection recovery and message queuing

### 1.3. Cross-Device Compatibility Testing Focus Areas
- **Responsive Design**: Visual regression testing across viewports
- **Browser Compatibility**: Testing across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
- **Network Conditions**: Testing under various bandwidth and connectivity scenarios

## 2. Test Environment Setup

### 2.1. Development Environment
- Local testing with mock data
- Unit tests running on save
- Integration tests before commits
