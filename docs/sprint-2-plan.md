# Sprint 2: Driver PWA & Live Tracking - Detailed Plan

## Overview
This sprint focuses on implementing the driver interface as a Progressive Web App (PWA) instead of a native mobile app, integrating live tracking functionality into the dispatcher dashboard, and implementing the Proof of Delivery (PoD) system. We'll be converting the existing frontend technology stack to support PWA capabilities while maintaining the existing dashboard functionality.

## Sprint Goals
1. Implement driver interface as a PWA with offline capabilities
2. Integrate live tracking functionality into the dispatcher dashboard
3. Implement Proof of Delivery functionality
4. Enable real-time updates between systems
5. Enhance backend APIs to support PWA features
6. Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Stack
- Node.js with Express.js
- PostgreSQL database
- WebSocket library (Socket.io or ws)
- RESTful API design with real-time extensions
- JSON for data exchange

### Frontend Stack
- React.js for both dashboard and driver interface
- Material-UI for consistent design
- Leaflet.js for map visualization
- Service workers for PWA functionality
- WebSocket client for real-time updates

### PWA Features
- Offline support for critical functionality
- Installable on mobile devices
- Push notifications for assignment updates
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Fast loading with caching strategies

### Data Models

#### Enhanced Shipment Model
```
- id (UUID)
- tracking_number (string, unique)
- status (enum: pending, assigned, in_transit, delivered, failed)
- origin (JSON: address details)
- destination (JSON: address details)
- assigned_driver_id (foreign key to Drivers)
- pod_image (string, URL to image)
- pod_timestamp (timestamp)
- pod_location (JSON: latitude, longitude)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

#### Enhanced Driver Model
```
- id (UUID)
- name (string)
- phone (string)
- vehicle_type (enum: bike, car, van)
- status (enum: available, busy, offline)
- current_location (JSON: latitude, longitude)
- location_history (JSON array of location/timestamp)
- last_active (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

#### Live Tracking Model
```
- id (UUID)
- shipment_id (foreign key to Shipments)
- driver_id (foreign key to Drivers)
- location_updates (JSON array of coordinates/timestamps)
- start_time (timestamp)
- end_time (timestamp)
```

## Success Criteria
