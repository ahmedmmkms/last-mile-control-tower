# Sprint 0: Project Scaffolding and Vercel Deployment Setup

## Overview
This sprint focused on setting up the basic project structure and preparing for deployment on Vercel. All necessary folders and configuration files have been created to support the development approach outlined in the Milestones.md document.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Folder Structure
Created a comprehensive folder structure based on the MVP requirements:
- `src/` - Main source code directory
  - `backend/` - Backend API services
    - `controllers/` - Request handlers
    - `routes/` - API route definitions
    - `models/` - Data models
    - `middleware/` - Custom middleware functions
    - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `frontend/` - Dispatcher Dashboard (React)
    - `components/` - Reusable UI components
    - `pages/` - Page components
    - `services/` - API service calls
    - `assets/` - Static assets (images, styles)
    - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `mobile/` - Driver Mobile App (React Native/Expo)
    - `components/` - Reusable UI components
    - `screens/` - Screen components
    - `services/` - API service calls
    - `assets/` - Static assets
    - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `database/` - Database schema and migrations
    - `migrations/` - Database migration files
    - `seeds/` - Database seed data
  - `shared/` - Shared code between services
  - `config/` - Configuration files
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `tests/` - Test files

### 2. Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Project metadata and dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Files and directories to exclude from Git
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `src/config/config.js` - Application configuration

### 3. Documentation
- `README.md` - Project overview and structure
- `docs/setup-guide.md` - Development environment setup instructions
- `docs/vercel-deployment-guide.md` - Step-by-step Vercel deployment instructions

## Next Steps
With the project structure in place, we can now proceed to Sprint 1 which focuses on:
- Backend API development for core entities
- Dispatcher dashboard with route visualization
- Basic admin interface for managing shipments/routes/drivers
- Database schema implementation
- Initial CI/CD setup

The foundation laid in this sprint will support the systematic development approach with continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that stakeholders can review progress at regular intervals while working toward the complete showcase MVP.
