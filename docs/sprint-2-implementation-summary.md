# Sprint 2 Implementation Summary: Backend Development (PWA Support & Live Tracking)

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of backend features for Sprint 2, focusing on PWA support and live tracking functionality. The implementation includes real-time WebSocket connections, enhanced APIs, database schema updates, and comprehensive testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time WebSocket Implementation
- Integrated Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Implemented authentication middleware for WebSocket connections
- Added connection logging and monitoring
- Configured CORS settings for cross-origin requests
- Created event handlers for:
  - Driver location updates
  - Driver assignment notifications
  - Driver room-based messaging

### 2. Enhanced RESTful APIs

#### Driver APIs
- `PUT /api/drivers/:id/location` - Update driver location with validation
- `PUT /api/drivers/:id/status` - Update driver status (available, busy, offline)
- `GET /api/drivers/:id/assignments` - Get driver's assigned shipments

#### Shipment APIs
- `PUT /api/shipments/:id/status` - Update shipment status with PoD data
- `POST /api/shipments/:id/pod` - Submit Proof of Delivery information

### 3. Database Schema Enhancements

#### Drivers Table
- Added `location_history` (JSONB) - Stores historical location data
- Added `last_active` (TIMESTAMP) - Tracks driver's last activity
- Added `availability` (BOOLEAN) - Driver availability status

#### Shipments Table
- Added `pod_image` (TEXT) - URL to Proof of Delivery image
- Added `pod_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP) - Timestamp of PoD submission
- Added `pod_location` (JSONB) - GPS location of PoD
- Added `status_history` (JSONB) - Historical status changes

#### Tracking Table
- Created new table for comprehensive tracking data
- Columns: id, shipment_id, driver_id, location, timestamp, event_type, metadata
- Indexes on shipment_id, driver_id, timestamp, and event_type

### 4. Backend Services

#### Location Tracking Service
- Location data validation and sanitization
- Driver location history storage and retrieval
- Tracking data storage with event types
- Automatic history trimming to prevent unbounded growth

### 5. Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests
- Location data validation functions
- WebSocket connection handling
- API endpoint validation

#### Integration Tests
- Real-time update broadcasting
- Driver assignment notifications
- Authentication flow testing

#### Performance Tests
- Concurrent WebSocket connections (50+ clients)
- Concurrent REST API requests
- Concurrent driver location updates

## Technical Details

### Authentication
- Token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- Driver authentication with success/failure responses
- Validation of authenticated actions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for location data
- Proper HTTP status codes for API responses
- WebSocket error event handling

### Data Validation
- Latitude/longitude coordinate validation
- Status value validation against allowed enums
- Required field validation for PoD submissions

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- History data trimming (last 100 locations)
- Efficient JSONB data storage

## Dependencies Added
- `socket.io` - Real-time WebSocket library
- `socket.io-client` - WebSocket client for testing
- `supertest` - HTTP testing library

## Configuration Changes
- Updated `index.js` to use HTTP server with Socket.IO
- Enhanced database connection handling
- Added periodic connection statistics logging

## Security Considerations
- CORS configuration for WebSocket connections
- Authentication middleware for Socket.IO
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Future Improvements
1. Implement JWT-based authentication for REST APIs
2. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Implement database connection pooling
4. Add Redis adapter for Socket.IO horizontal scaling
5. Implement message queuing for high-volume events
6. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
7. Implement data encryption for sensitive information

## Testing Results
- All unit tests passing
- Integration tests validate real-time functionality
- Performance tests handle 50+ concurrent users
- Authentication flows properly validated

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the PWA driver interface and real-time tracking functionality required for Sprint 2.
