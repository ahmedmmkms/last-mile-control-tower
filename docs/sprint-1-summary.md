# Sprint 1: Core Entities & Admin Dashboard - Progress Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of Sprint 1, which focuses on implementing the core backend APIs, database schema, and the dispatcher dashboard with route visualization.

## Sprint Goals
1. ✅ Implement backend APIs for core entities (Shipments, Routes, Drivers)
2. ✅ Create dispatcher dashboard with route visualization
3. ✅ Develop basic admin interface for managing core entities
4. ✅ Implement database schema and seed data
5. ✅ Enhance CI/CD pipeline with backend testing

## Progress Tracking

### Backend Development (Core Entities & APIs)

#### Database Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement database schema for:
  - [ ] Shipments table (id, tracking_number, status, origin, destination, assigned_driver_id, created_at, updated_at)
  - [ ] Routes table (id, shipment_id, waypoints, status, estimated_time, actual_time, created_at, updated_at)
  - [ ] Drivers table (id, name, phone, vehicle_type, status, current_location, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Create database migration files
- [ ] Implement seed data for demo purposes
- [ ] Set up database connection and configuration

#### Backend API Development
- [ ] Implement Shipment controller with CRUD operations:
  - [ ] GET /api/shipments - List all shipments
  - [ ] GET /api/shipments/:id - Get specific shipment
  - [ ] POST /api/shipments - Create new shipment
  - [ ] PUT /api/shipments/:id - Update shipment
  - [ ] DELETE /api/shipments/:id - Delete shipment
- [ ] Implement Route controller with CRUD operations:
  - [ ] GET /api/routes - List all routes
  - [ ] GET /api/routes/:id - Get specific route
  - [ ] POST /api/routes - Create new route
  - [ ] PUT /api/routes/:id - Update route
  - [ ] DELETE /api/routes/:id - Delete route
- [ ] Implement Driver controller with CRUD operations:
  - [ ] GET /api/drivers - List all drivers
  - [ ] GET /api/drivers/:id - Get specific driver
  - [ ] POST /api/drivers - Create new driver
  - [ ] PUT /api/drivers/:id - Update driver
  - [ ] DELETE /api/drivers/:id - Delete driver
- [ ] Implement route assignment logic:
  - [ ] Algorithm to assign shipments to drivers based on proximity
  - [ ] Update shipment and driver status upon assignment
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

#### Backend Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for all controller functions
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement test data fixtures
- [ ] Configure test database environment

### Frontend Development (Dispatcher Dashboard)

#### Dashboard UI Implementation
- [ ] Create dashboard layout with:
  - [ ] Header with navigation
  - [ ] Sidebar with menu options
  - [ ] Main content area for visualization
- [ ] Implement shipment list view:
  - [ ] Table with shipment details
  - [ ] Filter and search functionality
  - [ ] Status indicators
- [ ] Implement route visualization:
  - [ ] Map component for route display
  - [ ] Waypoint markers
  - [ ] Route path visualization
- [ ] Implement driver status panel:
  - [ ] List of drivers with current status
  - [ ] Location indicators
  - [ ] Assignment status

#### Admin Interface
- [ ] Create shipment management interface:
  - [ ] Form for creating/editing shipments
  - [ ] Validation for required fields
  - [ ] Status update functionality
- [ ] Create driver management interface:
  - [ ] Form for creating/editing drivers
  - [ ] Status management
  - [ ] Vehicle type selection
- [ ] Create route management interface:
  - [ ] Route creation wizard
  - [ ] Waypoint editor
  - [ ] Assignment interface

#### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Create component tests for UI elements
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for core workflows
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### CI/CD Enhancements
- [ ] Enhance GitHub Actions workflows with backend testing
- [ ] Add database migration steps to deployment pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment-specific settings
- [ ] Implement automated API testing in CI pipeline

## Current Status
