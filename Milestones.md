# P2 Last-Mile Delivery Control Tower - MVP Development Plan 
  
## 1. Showcase MVP Requirements  
  
For the showcase MVP, we'll focus on demonstrating the core functionality with a clean, presentable interface: 
  
### Core Features for MVP:  
1. **Dispatcher Dashboard** - Visualize active routes and driver status  
2. **Route Assignment** - Assign shipments to drivers with basic optimization  
3. **Driver Mobile App** - Basic driver interface for accepting deliveries  
4. **Live Tracking** - Real-time location updates on the dashboard  
5. **Proof of Delivery** - Simple OTP-based delivery confirmation  
6. **Basic Analytics** - Dashboard with delivery metrics 
  
### Showcase Requirements:  
- Clean, professional UI with responsive design  
- Demo data to showcase functionality without real-world dependencies  
- Simulated driver movements for live tracking demonstration  
- Simple authentication for dispatcher and driver roles  
- Deployment to vercel.app for easy access and demonstration 
  
## 2. Sprint Structure  
  
Based on the P2 milestones and allowing for CI/CD, we'll structure development in 3 sprints of 2-3 weeks each: 
  
### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-3): Core Entities & Admin Dashboard 
- Backend API development for core entities  
- Dispatcher dashboard with route visualization  
- Basic admin interface for managing shipments/routes/drivers  
- Database schema implementation  
- Initial CI/CD setup 
  
### Sprint 2 (Weeks 4-6): Driver App & PoD  
- Mobile app development with React Native/Expo  
- Driver authentication and assignment interface  
- Live tracking implementation  
- Proof of delivery functionality  
- Integration with backend APIs 
  
### Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-9): COD & SLA Monitoring  
- Cash on delivery functionality  
- SLA monitoring dashboard  
- Analytics and reporting features  
- Final UI/UX refinements  
- Testing and bug fixes  
- Production deployment 
  
## 3. CI/CD Pipeline for Vercel Deployment  
  
### Backend CI/CD:  
1. GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to main branch  
2. Automated testing of API endpoints  
3. Docker image build and push to container registry  
4. Automated deployment to cloud hosting (AWS/Heroku) for API  
5. Database migrations handled through deployment scripts 
  
### Frontend CI/CD (Vercel):  
1. Automatic deployment from GitHub repository on push to main  
2. Preview deployments for pull requests  
3. Custom domain configuration (p2-demo.vercel.app)  
4. Environment variables management through Vercel dashboard  
5. Automatic HTTPS and performance optimizations 
  
### Mobile App CI/CD:  
1. GitHub Actions for build automation  
2. Expo Application Services (EAS) for building and distribution  
3. Preview builds for testing  
4. App Store/Play Store deployment process 
  
## 4. Sprint Breakdown with Tasks 
  
## 5. Sprint Deliverables  
  
### Sprint 1 Deliverables:  
- Deployed admin dashboard (vercel.app)  
- Working backend APIs with documentation  
- Database with sample data  
- Basic authentication system  
- CI/CD pipeline for frontend and backend 
  
### Sprint 2 Deliverables:  
- Functional driver mobile app (Expo preview)  
- Live tracking working on dashboard  
- End-to-end delivery flow  
- Proof of delivery functionality  
- Real-time updates between systems 
  
### Sprint 3 Deliverables:  
- Complete showcase MVP  
- COD tracking and reconciliation  
- SLA monitoring dashboard  
- Analytics and reporting features  
- Production deployment ready  
- User documentation and guides 
  
This plan allows for a systematic development approach with continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that stakeholders can review progress at regular intervals while working toward the complete showcase MVP.
